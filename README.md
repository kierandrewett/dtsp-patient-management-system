# Patient Management System

## Prerequisites

This project requires you to have **Microsoft Access** or the **Microsoft Access Database Engine** installed on your computer.
* The latter can be downloaded for free from microsoft.com at: https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/download-and-install-microsoft-365-access-runtime-185c5a32-8ba9-491e-ac76-91cbe3ea09c9

## Troubleshooting

### Administrator login

The default administrator username is `root@prs.uk` and the password will be whatever you set during the initial account setup.

### Unable to access administrator account

You can try deleting the `PMS.accdb` database file located under the `bin/Debug/net8.0-windows` or `bin/Release/net8.0-windows` folder and relaunching the application.
